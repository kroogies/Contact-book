# Contact-book
Newbie project made by Kroogies, took 3 weeks. 

I decided to post this project on github just to preserve it. This is the longest and largest project I have made that has at least 600+ lines of code
and I'm very proud of that.

I apologize for the bad naming style with my functions and variables, it might look like a disgrace to the eyes of other developers out there.

I'm also hoping to get suggestions from other people on github. I hope to improve this newbie project with other people's ideas.
Also, feel free to contribute to this project as I'm also looking forward to seeing what other devs would do with my simple contact book.

This was made with Python, tkinter gui library, pillow library, and with sqlite3 database.

This newbie project was made by a learning programmer who's only been learning for a month, just so you know. C:
And I thank you, for reading this boring README file.
